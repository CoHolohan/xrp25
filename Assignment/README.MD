## Project Overview
is an immersive Extended Reality (XR) experience inspired by the classic *Fruit Ninja* game.  
In this interactive simulation, various food items fall from the sky, and the player uses hand-tracking or motion controllers to slice them in midair. The sliced pieces then fall naturally into a pot, earning the player points

The UN Sustainability development Goal this relates to would be no.2 Zero Hunger

The goal of the project is to create a fun and intuitive XR environment that leverages spatial interaction and physics-based gameplay, offering users an engaging, physically interactive experience.

## Core Features
- **XR-based slicing interaction** using hand gestures
- **Physics-based food slicing** and realistic motion of food fragments  
- **Dynamic scoring system** based on accuracy and combo slicing  
- **Immersive sound and haptic feedback** for each successful cut  
- **3D pot collection mechanic** where sliced remains fall into a container  
- **Stylized 3D environment** with interactive spatial audio and effects  

## XR Frameworks & Plugins
- **Godot XR Tools** – Provides interaction nodes, XR origin setups, and hand/controller tracking.
- **OpenXR Plugin** – Enables cross-platform XR support (VR headsets and AR devices).
- **Godot XR Hands / Controllers** – Used for hand tracking, controller input, and slicing gesture detection.

---

## Interaction Libraries
- **XR Interaction Toolkit (Godot XR Tools)** – For implementing direct and ray-based interactions.
- **Godot XR Input Mapper** – To handle gesture detection (slice, grab, throw).
- **Godot Physics Engine** – For simulating falling objects and fragment collisions.
- **Godot Visual Scripting / Input Actions** – To map user slicing motions to game actions.

## Assets & Design Tools
- **Blender** – For modeling fruits, pots, and environment assets.
- **Audacity** – For sound design and slicing effects.
- **FreeSound / Poly Haven** – Sources for open-licensed textures and audio clips.
